| **Mod ID** | `buildcraftrefabricated` |
| **Version** | `26.1.2-1` |

BuildCraft Refabricated extends Minecraft with pipes, engines, quarries, gates, oil processing, auto-crafting, and the rest of the classic BuildCraft automation toolkit. This is the **unofficial Fabric port** for **Minecraft 26.1.2**, developed and published from **[fromdisposition/BuildCraftRefabricated](https://github.com/fromdisposition/BuildCraftRefabricated)**.

The modern 26.1.2 gameplay code traces back to **[legoj15's NeoForge port](https://github.com/legoj15/BuildCraft)** (NeoForge, not Fabric). **This repository** is where that tree is migrated to Fabric and maintained: Transfer API interop (`FabricTransferBridge`), BC 8.0-faithful fluid rendering, pipe/attachment fixes, transactional transfer cleanup, and release work all land here.

## What this mod is

BuildCraft Refabricated ships as a **single Fabric mod** that bundles every module that BC 8 distributed as separate Forge JARs:

| Module | Package | Contents (summary) |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Core** | `buildcraft.core` | Landmarks, volume boxes, marker tools, map location, robot goggles, list mod, springs, creative/redstone engines |
| **Lib** | `buildcraft.lib` | Shared GUI, tiles, transfer system, client rendering, mixins, guide infrastructure |
| **Energy** | `buildcraft.energy` | Stone/iron/FE engines, dynamo, oil & fuel fluids (3 heat tiers), buckets, worldgen |
| **Transport** | `buildcraft.transport` | Item, fluid, MJ, and RF pipes; pluggables; wire systems; filtered buffer |
| **Factory** | `buildcraft.factory` | Tank, pump, flood gate, distiller, heat exchange, chute, auto workbench (items + fluids), mining well |
| **Builders** | `buildcraft.builders` | Quarry, filler, architect table, builder, blueprints, schematics |
| **Silicon** | `buildcraft.silicon` | Assembly/integration/advanced crafting tables, lasers, gates, facades, lenses |
| **Robotics** | `buildcraft.robotics` | Zone planner, deployable robots, docking stations, requester (see matrix for gaps) |
| **Fabric adapter** | `buildcraft.fabric` | Registries, networking, config, client events, module bootstrap |

**Entry points:**

- Server/common: `buildcraft.fabric.BuildCraftFabricMod`
- Client: `buildcraft.fabric.BuildCraftFabricClient`

This is **not** a byte-for-byte clone of every BC 8 behaviour. Minecraft 26.1.2 differs from 1.12.2 in recipes, components, rendering, and entity APIs. The goal is **ideological continuation** of BuildCraft — pipe logic, MJ network, oil ecosystem, quarry automation — with honest engineering for Fabric and modern MC.

## Fabric port improvements

The items below are **Fabric-port and maintenance work** in [BuildCraftRefabricated](https://github.com/fromdisposition/BuildCraftRefabricated), on top of the NeoForge-derived 26.1.2 base (and relative to classic BC 8.0.x on Forge 1.12.2). Everything listed is code-backed, not aspirational.

### Platform and distribution

- **Single mod JAR** instead of BC8's separate Core / Transport / Energy / Factory / Builders / Silicon / Robotics modules.
- **Minecraft 26.1.2** with Fabric Loader, Fabric API, and Java 25.
- **Deferred and runtime registries** via `buildcraft.fabric.registry.*` and `BCRegistries` for blocks, items, fluids, block entities, and data components.
- **Unified JSON config** (`buildcraftrefabricated-common.json` via `BCFabricConfig`) covering core, lib, energy, factory, and transport settings; reloadable on datapack reload.
- **Custom Fabric networking** (`BuildCraftFabricNetworking`) for pipe items, payloads, wire systems, and landing effects.

### Transfer system rewrite

BC8 used Forge `IFluidHandler` and `IItemHandler` directly. This port introduces a unified transactional layer:

- **`ResourceHandler<T>`** — typed insert/extract with slot support (`buildcraft.lib.transfer`).
- **`Transaction` / `TransactionContext`** — simulate-then-commit semantics across pipes, tanks, and bridges.
- **`IFluidHandlerAdv`** — modern fluid API extending `ResourceHandler<FluidResource>` (replaces legacy `lib/fluids/capability/IFluidHandler`).

**Removed dead legacy** (no longer referenced anywhere):

- `lib/fluids/capability/IFluidHandler.java`
- `lib/fluids/capability/templates/FluidTank.java`
- `lib/misc/MultiTankResourceHandler.java`

### Attachments API (capability replacement)

NeoForge-style attachments adapted for Fabric (`buildcraft.lib.attachments`):

| Attachment | Contexts |
|------------|----------|
| `Attachments.Fluid.BLOCK` / `ITEM` | Sided blocks, fluid container items |
| `Attachments.Item.BLOCK` / `ITEM` / `ENTITY` | Inventories, bundles, player automation |
| `Attachments.Energy.BLOCK` | Internal FE storage (engines, dynamo, RF pipes) |

**Vanilla providers** (`AttachmentHooks.init()`):

- Chests, trapped chests, furnaces, blast furnaces, smokers, hoppers, barrels, dispensers, droppers, shulker boxes
- All vanilla `BucketItem`s (except `buildcraftenergy` buckets registered separately)
- Players (inventory wrappers)
- Composter
- **Cauldron fluid content** — new vs BC8 (`CauldronFluidContent`)

**Per-module registration** in `BCCoreFabric`, `BCEnergyFabric`, `BCFactoryFabric`, `BCTransportFabric`, `BCBuildersFabric`, etc.

**Resolution chain** (`BlockAttachment.getCapability`):

1. Registered block/BE provider
2. `FabricTransferBridge.tryWrapForward` for external Fabric mods
3. `null`

`AttachmentLevelAccess` (level mixin) adds caching and invalidation on block changes.

### Fabric Transfer API bridge

`FabricTransferBridge` (`buildcraft.lib.fabric.transfer`) is the core interoperability layer.

**BC → Fabric (fallbacks registered at init):**

| Fabric API | BC wrapper |
|------------|------------|
| `FluidStorage.SIDED` | `BcFluidStorage` |
| `ItemStorage.SIDED` | `BcItemStorage` |
| `FluidStorage.ITEM` | `BcFluidStorage` (BC providers only, via `getCapabilityFromProvidersOnly`) |

**Fabric → BC (forward wrap in attachment lookup):**

| Fabric API | BC wrapper |
|------------|------------|
| `FluidStorage.SIDED` | `FabricFluidResourceHandler` |
| `ItemStorage.SIDED` | `FabricItemResourceHandler` |
| `FluidStorage.ITEM` | `FabricFluidResourceHandler` (via `ItemAttachment` + `tryWrapItemFluid`) |

**Safety mechanisms:**

- `ThreadLocal REENTRANT` guard prevents infinite BC↔Fabric lookup loops.
- `FabricTransactionMirror` / `FabricToBcTransactionMirror` nest Fabric and BC transactions so simulate/commit stay aligned.
- `TransferConvert` maps Fabric droplets to BC millibuckets (81 droplets = 1 mB); cross-mod moves use **whole mB only**.

**Item fluid containers:**

- `ContainerItemContextItemAccess` maps Fabric `ContainerItemContext` to BC `ItemAccess` for correct read/write.
- BC buckets registered in `BCEnergyFabric.registerBucketAttachments()`.
- Fragile fluid shards in `BCCoreFabric`.
- `AttachmentHooks` skips `buildcraftenergy` buckets to avoid double registration.

### Pipe transport enhancements

Improvements over BC8 pipe behaviour and interop:

| Area | Change | Key files |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Fluid section extract | Real `Section.extract` with `drainInternal`, `canOutput`, fluid match, empty cleanup | `PipeFlowFluids.java` |
| Advanced fluid filter | `tryExtractFluidAdv` applies `IFluidFilter.matches()` before extract | `PipeFlowFluids.java` |
| Section NBT | Writes `"amount"`, reads with fallback `"capacity"` | `PipeFlowFluids.java` |
| Sided fluid dedup | `SidedFluidHandlers.insertOnly` / `extractOnly` for pump, distiller, heat exchange | `SidedFluidHandlers.java`, `BCFactoryFabric.java` |
| Fluid item bridge | Mod fluid cells visible to diamond filter and `FluidUtilBC.isFluidContainerItem()` | `FabricTransferBridge.java`, `ItemAttachment.java` |
| Item pipe Fabric insert | `PipeItemInjectHandler` on `PIPE_HOLDER` — external mods insert via `ItemStorage.SIDED` | `PipeItemInjectHandler.java`, `BCTransportFabric.java` |
| Item extract from tiles | `tryExtractItems` uses `Attachments.Item.BLOCK` + transactions | `PipeFlowItems.java` |
| Force inject client sync | `insertItemsForce` calls `addItemTryMerge` → `sendItemDataToClient` | `PipeFlowItems.java` |
| Power/RF display dedup | Shared `PipeEnergyEnumFlow`, `PipeEnergyDisplaySupport` (client anim, network sync, neighbour propagate) | `PipeEnergyEnumFlow.java`, `PipeEnergyDisplaySupport.java` |
| PipeRegistry API | `createItemForPipe` / `createUnnamedItemForPipe` implemented via `BCRegistries` | `PipeRegistry.java` |

### Fluid rendering (BC 8.0 visual fidelity)

BC8 used `AtlasSpriteFluid` on 1.12.2. The Fabric port reimplements that look on modern vertex consumers:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `FluidUtilBC.FluidRenderContext` | Centralized render context (world/BER/GUI vs pipe recolor) |
| `FluidUtilBC.FluidAppearance` / `vertexRgba()` | Single appearance API for tint and alpha |
| `BcFluidTintUtil` | Heat-template bake and per-vertex pipe recolor |
| `BcFluidBakeSpriteSource` | Atlas-stitched baked still/flow sprites for world/BER/GUI |
| `BcHeatWhiteSpriteSource` | White pipe sprites with `.mcmeta` animation metadata copied into `SpriteContents` |
| `BcFluidQuadEmitter` | 16×16 subdivided quads with per-vertex heat gradient in pipes |
| `BcFluidGuiDrawer` | Shared tiled GUI tank drawing |
| `BcFluidQuadEmitter.emitTankQuad` / `emitTankHorizontal` | Deduped BER tank rendering |
| `BCEnergyFabricClient` | `FluidRenderingRegistry` registration with baked sprites |

**Pipe fluid UV fix:** face-grid `(u,v)` converted to sprite `normalizedU/V(tu,tv)` so heat gradients align correctly on pipe faces.

### Pipe dye bands and blocks atlas

BC8 baked ~350 dyed fluid-pipe sprites via `dye_replace` into the blocks atlas. The Fabric port replaces that with **runtime vertex tint**:

| Area | Change | Key files |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Atlas | Removed `buildcraftlib:dye_replace` entries and `DyeReplaceSpriteSource` (~350 fewer stitched sprites) | `blocks.json`, `BCSpriteSourcesFabric.java` |
| World pipes | BER mask overlay tints the waterproofing band; fluid pipes use alpha 255 (opaque dye), other colourable pipes keep alpha 76 | `RenderPipeHolder.java`, `PipeBaseModelGenStandard.generateMaskMutable` |
| Item pipes | Overlay quads coplanar with base model; fluid item tint alpha `0xFF` | `PipeItemModel.java` |
| Item travel | Client-side simulation when items are in transit (no choppy BER animation) | `PipeFlowItems.hasClientSimulationWork()` |

### Code hygiene (recent cleanup)

- Removed `DyeReplaceSpriteSource` and all `dye_replace` atlas sources; pipe dye bands use mask + vertex colour instead.
- Fixed item pipe client interpolation (`hasClientSimulationWork` no longer skips the client).
- Removed empty `PipeFlowRendererItems` stub; colour overlay quads moved to `PipeItemColourQuads`.
- Removed unused `IFluidHandlerAdv` imports from `PipeFlowFluids`, `FluidUtilBC`, `IFlowFluid`.
- Removed dead method `getFirstNonEmptySet()` from `PipeFlowItems`.
- Bucket attachment dedup: `AttachmentHooks` skips `buildcraftenergy` namespace buckets already registered in `BCEnergyFabric`.
- AUDIT hot-path performance and nativeness fixes (caching, Fabric-native APIs on pipe/transfer/render paths).

## Transfer API interoperability

Reference for mod developers connecting to BuildCraft on Fabric.

| Resource | BC attachment / API | Fabric API | Direction |
|----------|---------------------|------------|-----------|
| Block fluids | `Attachments.Fluid.BLOCK` | `FluidStorage.SIDED` | **Both ways** |
| Block items | `Attachments.Item.BLOCK` | `ItemStorage.SIDED` | **Both ways** |
| Item fluids (buckets, cells) | `Attachments.Fluid.ITEM` | `FluidStorage.ITEM` | **Both ways** |
| Block energy (RF) | `Attachments.Energy.BLOCK` | `EnergyStorage.SIDED` (Team Reborn) | **BC → Fabric** when RF autoconversion enabled |
| MJ power | `MjAPI.CAP_RECEIVER` / `CAP_CONNECTOR` / `CAP_PASSIVE_PROVIDER` | — | BC internal only |
| RF pipes | `PipeFlowRedstoneFlux` | `EnergyStorage.SIDED` on `PIPE_HOLDER` | **Both ways** with Team Reborn API mods |

### What works without custom compat code

- Fabric fluid tanks, hoppers, pipes → BC fluid pipes, tanks, pump, engines (via sided fluid storage).
- Fabric item automation → BC item pipes, chests, machines (bidirectional via `PipeItemInjectStorage` / sided item storage).
- Fabric fluid container items → BC diamond fluid filter, tank GUI fill/drain, `isFluidContainerItem()`.
- BC buckets and fluid shards → visible to other mods querying `FluidStorage.ITEM`.

### What does not bridge

- External **MJ** mods — BC MJ API only.
- **MJ↔RF conversion** on BC machines — requires disabling `MJ_ONLY` and enabling RF autoconversion in config; off by default.
- Item pipe **nested transaction rollback** — `PipeItemInjectStorage` can leave partial state if a nested Fabric transaction aborts mid-flow.

## Known limitations

Honest list of current gaps and design constraints:

1. **Maintenance scope** — Focus is bugfixes and port stability, not major new features.
2. **Not Minecraft 1.12.2** — Recipes, components, redstone, entities, and the mod ecosystem differ from BC8.
3. **RF/MJ energy interop gated by config** — Team Reborn `EnergyStorage` is bundled and wired for RF pipes and several machines; external mods using the same API can interact when RF autoconversion is enabled. MJ pipes remain BC-internal; `MJ_ONLY` is the default.
4. **Fluid bridge granularity** — Cross-mod fluid moves truncate to whole millibuckets (81 Fabric droplets = 1 mB).
5. **Wood pipe required for extraction** — Cobble/gold/iron fluid and item pipes do not passively drain neighbours; wood + MJ is by BC design.
6. **Multi-tank fluid extract** — Unfiltered external fluid pulls may return the first tank view in iteration order, not a merged multi-tank handler.
7. **List mod builder gap** — List GUI/NBT works and lists filter pipes/robots/gates, but filler and builder do not consume list items yet.
8. **Robotics survival loop gap** — No recipe for empty `buildcraftrobotics:robot` shell; chain is redstone board → programming table → integration table → docking station deploy.
9. **Guide book content incomplete** — 164 pages load; robotics guide has only `zone_planner.md`; several silicon tables (e.g. programming table) also lack writeups; missing entries auto-stub as WIP.
10. **Dev-only blocks** — Engine power tester and decorated debug blocks register only with `-Dbuildcraft.dev=true`; creative engine is always available.
11. **Engine explosion default** — `canEnginesExplode` defaults to `false`; BC 8 commonly used `true`.
12. **RF autoconversion off by default** — Config `MJ_ONLY`; enabling RF↔MJ conversion exposes `EnergyStorage` on BC machines and is required for cross-mod RF tank/engine interop beyond RF pipes.
13. **Pipe flow transactions** — Pipe internals mutate immediately; nested transaction rollback does not fully undo travelling items (especially `PipeItemInjectStorage`).
14. **MJ loss particles** — Engine spark effects are no-op (`NullaryEffectManager`); gameplay MJ loss still applies.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 25**
- **Git**

Gradle wrapper is included; a separate Gradle install is optional.

### Commands

From a clone of [BuildCraftRefabricated](https://github.com/fromdisposition/BuildCraftRefabricated):

```bash
./gradlew build        # Unix / macOS
gradlew.bat build      # Windows
```

On success, `build/libs/` contains:

- `BCRefabricated-{version}.jar` — release mod JAR (e.g. `BCRefabricated-26.1.2-1.jar`)
- `BCRefabricated-{version}-sources.jar` — sources (optional)

Copy the release JAR into your Minecraft `mods` folder manually (or use `gradlew runClient` for a dev instance).
